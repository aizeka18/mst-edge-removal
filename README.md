# MST Edge Removal and Replacement

This Java program demonstrates efficient edge removal from a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and finding optimal replacement edges to maintain the MST property.

## Features

- Builds Minimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's algorithm
- Removes edges from MST and shows resulting components
- Finds optimal replacement edges to reconnect components
- Maintains MST properties after edge replacement
- Comprehensive demonstration with sample graphs

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Git (for cloning)
